Void presents a falling figure, but its only when one considers it to think about the implications of the artwork that one can imagine oneself as this person, endlessly falling. This conjures up a feeling of hopelessness, that nothing matters which perhaps prompts a series of existential questions: what existence is, do I matter... This work is not nihilistic but serves to invite the audience to consider the work, and their singular existence, on an emotional level and in so doing demonstrate that their feelings in this regard are indeed mirrored in each of us; that they are not alone.
