Black Flame’s silent yet commanding presence stands as a metaphor for the felt experience, depth, insecurity and fears of a person. Its acrylic surface provides a reflective limited animation to its surface. Its vertical, organic, static form elicits a suspended drama captured in what can be simultaneously read as a burnt stunted tree or as a cold frozen flame; as inevitably finite.
